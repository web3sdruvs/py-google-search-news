# py-google-search-news
This repository was created with the purpose of providing an example of how to perform automated news searches on Google using the BeautifulSoup (bs4) library. The bot is configured through a [config.ini](https://github.com/web3sdruvs/py-google-search-news/blob/main/src/config.ini) file, where users can define parameters such as keywords and date filters to customize the search.
